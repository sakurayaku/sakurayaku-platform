# TL;DR

* This project's aim is to translate Sakura Taisen on Saturn in ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡·FrenchğŸ‡«ğŸ‡·, and, if participation/demand is met, ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ªprobably ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡¸other ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡¹languages.

* We are taking off from the AWESOME work done by [NoahSteam and others](https://www.romhacking.net/translations/5318/). They agreed to share the data and knowledge with us. Therefore, we share back.

* We have a platform available [online](https://sakurayaku.herokuapp.com/admin/), it's invite-only to prevent spam and other atrocities, but just come over to Discord and ask over for an account.

* You can join us (in English) over at [our Discord(https://discord.gg/BqcaJBHz). If you wish to do other languages, we'd be happy to set you up on our platform.


# The code

You should be able to reuse this as-is, but you'll need the extracted data (TODO: link to repo and/or iwakura Discord), then run `db:seed` to import it into a database.

There is no license for the code here because I don't know what license the original team put their work on (though it seemed to be akin to "Here you go, have fun with it") and apart from a few tricks here and there, there's nothing that would warrant a licensing :)
